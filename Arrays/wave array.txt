may have multiple solutions

[lexicographic  O(nlogn)]
1. sort
2. swap adjacent elements with i+=2 in loop


result: a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5 ......


[for a random solution	O(n)]
1. swap even  posi elements (0,2,4,..) with adjacent odd elements.
2. Traverse all even positioned elements of input array, and do following.
….a) If current element is smaller than previous odd element, swap previous and current.
….b) If current element is smaller than next odd element, swap next and current.
